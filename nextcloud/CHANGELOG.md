## Update to latest upstream
Version 26.0.0
## Possible breaking changes
I'm playing cat and mouse with the upstream container, I had to refactor how the container is built. It's now very similar to the [alexbelgium](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons) implementation. It's possible your install will not migrate, I have a very limited test suite. Make a backup prior to upgrading.
